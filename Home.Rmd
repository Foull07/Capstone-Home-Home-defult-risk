# Business Problem Statement
Home Credit aims to promote financial inclusion by offering safe and accessible loans to unbanked individuals. A significant challenge in developing markets is the inability to assess creditworthiness due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. This often leads to loan rejections or reliance on predatory lenders. To address this, Home Credit seeks a reliable, data-driven method to predict repayment abilities using alternative data sources, such as telecommunications and transactional information. The goal is to reduce default rates while increasing loan approvals for creditworthy clients.

# Datasets
This dataset provides detailed information about consumers who have received credit from Home Credit. It includes both demographic and business-related data to facilitate the credit approval process.

The primary dataset, application_train, serves as the foundation for building predictive models. It can also be enhanced with additional insights derived from this table or other external data sources. This table contains 122 columns and 307,511 rows, with data types categorized as character, numeric, or integer.

A comprehensive description of each variable is available in a CSV file, which is not included here due to its length. For full access to these descriptions, visit: Kaggle - Home Credit Default Risk Dataset.
```{r}
# Load the training and test datasets
Home_train <- read.csv("application_train.csv")
Home_test <- read.csv("application_test.csv")
# Preview the structure of the datasets
str(Home_train)

```

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase focuses on understanding the structure and content of the application_train dataset, identifying anomalies or inconsistencies, and uncovering patterns or relationships between the target variable and other features. This step is critical for ensuring data quality and gaining insights that align with the companyâ€™s strategic objectives.

To maintain clarity and conciseness, only the most relevant analyses and visualizations will be highlighted in this document. While some supporting code may be included for transparency, its outputs might not be displayed to keep the focus on key findings.

# Results and Conclusion
Results:
The analysis and modeling efforts on the application_train dataset have provided valuable insights and actionable outcomes for the business problem of predicting loan repayment ability. Key findings include:

Exploratory Data Analysis:

The target variable (TARGET) revealed a significant class imbalance, with approximately 92% of applicants classified as non-defaulters and 8% as defaulters. This highlights the need for careful model evaluation using metrics like AUC to ensure predictive accuracy for the minority class.
Several variables, such as EXT_SOURCE_2, AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, and DAYS_BIRTH, demonstrated strong relationships with the target variable, providing a basis for feature importance in modeling.

Modeling:
A logistic regression model was used as a baseline. While interpretable, it had limitations in capturing non-linear relationships.
The Random Forest model emerged as the best-performing algorithm, with a high AUC score on the training data and robust handling of both categorical and continuous features. Its feature importance analysis indicated that variables like EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_3, and DAYS_EMPLOYED were the most predictive.
Insights from Feature Importance:

External scores (EXT_SOURCE_2 and EXT_SOURCE_3) were the most influential features, underscoring the value of alternative data sources in assessing creditworthiness.
Demographic and employment-related features, such as DAYS_BIRTH and DAYS_EMPLOYED, also played a significant role, aligning with the businessâ€™s goal of identifying reliable applicants despite limited traditional credit histories.

Conclusion:
The findings from this project provide a data-driven framework for addressing Home Creditâ€™s business objective of broadening financial inclusion while managing risk. By leveraging predictive modeling, particularly Random Forest, the company can:

1. Improve approval rates for creditworthy applicants by accurately identifying repayment potential.
2. Reduce default rates by effectively screening high-risk applicants.
3. Utilize alternative data sources, such as external scores, to mitigate the challenges posed by the lack of traditional credit history.

Future work could explore further enhancements, such as hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model, the inclusion of additional external data sources, or the application of advanced machine learning techniques like XGBoost. Additionally, strategies to address class imbalance, such as SMOTE or cost-sensitive learning, could further improve the modelâ€™s performance for minority class predictions.
